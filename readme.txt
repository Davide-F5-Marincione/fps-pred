Hi, this is Davide and Dario's project: unfortunately, it is pretty big, so we had to split it up into
three sections: a main folder (this one), a pickles.7z and a regressions.7z (with all of our regressed models).
But do not fret, it is really simple to recompose it, you just have to extract all the pickles
in this main folder and put the "regressions" folder in this main one.

Have a great time! D&D.
